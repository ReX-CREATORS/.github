### About us
`StarlitMod` is a game plugin Mod open-source group founded by a group of like-minded friends who came together.

`StarlitMod`is dedicated to the development of game mods, primarily creating mods for the GTA series (for Android or PC). Of course, we will also pay attention to other games.

Here, we will store the open-source code for some game plugin mods and related projects.

The name `StarlitMod` was decided through a discussion involving members in the group.
